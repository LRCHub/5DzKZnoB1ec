Spiritual isolation
The ultimate frustration
Scratch the surface
Turn another page
The ugly truth

Or another pretty lie
You deceived me
I believed you

Why did everything go...
So wrong...
For so long?
So the truth
Comes out at last
I'm dead inside

(I'm burning up)
A hollow shell
(My private hell)
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell
Then we were young and strong
Now everything is wrong
Did you want me

Did you need me
Could you not say
You believed me?
Everything we had is gone...
Like an old forgotten song
The deceiver and believer
Now everything is...
So wrong... for so long.
